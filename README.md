# VehicleDetection
Vision-based video monitoring systems offer several advantages. Tracking moving vehicles in video streams has been an active area of research in computer vision. The main aim is to detect and recognize moving objects vehicles from real surveillance videos to avoidcongestion on highways and parking areas for the prevention of accidents In addition to vehicle counts, a much larger set of traffic parameters such as vehicle classifications, lane changes, etc., can  be measured. Vehicle classification is important in the computation of the percentages of vehicle classes that use state-aid streets and highways. Even in large metropolitan areas, there is a need for data about vehicle classes that use a particular street. A classification system like the one proposed here can provide important data for a particular design scenario. To keep an eye on all the vehicles in a particular time domain, finding out accidents caused by overtaking, monitoring the speed of the vehicles are the motivation for this work. Here is overview of the work :
